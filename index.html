          My favorite brand of popcorn kernels is Orville Redenbacher. I still remember the commercials from the '70s and '80s in which Redenbacher himself asserted that his kernels popped up lighter and fluffier than the leading brands, and I've found that to be true in real life. But I like the Pop Secret popcorn kernel CONTAINER better, because the lid is a half-cup measuring cup, perfect for measuring out the kernels before popping. So, what I do is, I buy Orville Redenbacher popcorn kernels and I transfer the kernels into an empty Pop Secret container. If you ever looked in my kitchen cabinet, you might think I had (expired) Pop Secret popcorn kernels in there, but I really don't. They're Orville Redenbacher popcorn kernels in disguise.

          In the early '00s, I wrote for an online humor magazine called Satireville, an Onionesque site with a slight focus on Western Massachusetts politics and culture. I wrote under the pseudonym George Cotton Strunly (an anagram of Gregory Scott Tulonen) because my regular job (at a news website) did not permit me to write for an outside organization, particularly a satirical news site. One day, at my regular job, a colleague told me about a story he'd read in Satireville, one I happened to have written â€” though he didn't know that; it was just a story he'd read that he thought was funny. I wanted so badly to say "I wrote that!", but this was in front of my boss (who, if he's reading this, may be learning about all of this for the first time), so all I could do was say, "That sounds funny" and go back to my desk.

        <div class="caption-text"> Sometimes, when I give my name over the phone, I'll be asked "Is that Gregg with two Gs?" Invariably, I will answer, "Yes. But not in a row." This response usually elicits either silence or confusion, so I will offer this clarification: "Otherwise my name would be Gre."

        <div class="caption-text"> Hello, and welcome to the fourth episode of "Greg Tulonen Secrets."
          
          Sometime in the late '80s or early '90s, my dad bought himself a minivan. I'm not sure why. He was living alone at the time, and most of his driving was done solo, so what did he need with a minivan? If I ever knew the answer to that question, I've forgotten it, but I do remember that it made him happy.
          
          He let me drive it when I came home for summer break. One morning, I took him to work and then drove to the grocery store to buy myself some Ben & Jerry's.
          
          When I came out of the store, I got into the minivan, but I couldn't get it started. I don't mean the engine wouldn't turn over. I mean, I couldn't even get the key to turn. You know how sometimes, the key won't turn, but you jiggle the steering wheel a little and then you're fine? This wasn't that. I jiggled that steering wheel like it was a vending machine holding a stuck bag of Funyuns. Nothing.
          
          There I was, sitting in my dad's minivan, trying to figure out what to do next. I could find a payphone and call my dad at work, but then what? I had his car. What was he going do? I could find a payphone and call the police, but what were they going do? Come down and arrest me for being such a loser? So, I just sort of hung my head in defeat like Charlie Brown after a baseball game, and that's when I saw a baby pacifier on the passenger seat.
          
          At that time, there were no babies in the family.
          
          I thought about that, about the baby pacifier, for about a tenth of a second, and while I was thinking about it, the side door of the minivan slid open, and a woman started loading up a baby into a heretofore unnoticed infant car seat in the back seat. I could see this clearly in the rearview mirror.
          
          You got it a little faster than I did: This was not my dad's minivan.
          
          As you might imagine, this was kind of an awkward moment for me. I couldn't say anything without alerting this woman to my presence. But I also couldn't exit the vehicle without alerting this woman to my presence. And she was seconds away from being alerted to my presence anyway simply by virtue of possessing a pair of eyes.
          
          "Um," I said (because you have to start somewhere).
          
          "I think you're in the wrong car," the woman said, far more calmly and cheerfully than I deserved. "Is that your wife loading groceries in the car next to this one?"
          
          I looked to my left, and indeed, there was an identical minivan parked directly next to this one, with a young woman loading groceries into it. I had never seen her before in my life.
          
          "Yes," I said, because at that point it seemed simpler to agree, and I hastily exited the vehicle, uttering all appropriate apologies. Then I sort-of hung out on the periphery of both vehicles until the woman with the baby had pulled away, lest she wonder why I was also walking away from my "wife." Then, I started to look for my dad's minivan in earnest.
          
          Here's the embarrassing part. (I know what you're thinking: "THAT wasn't the embarrassing part?") It turned out, when I did find my dad's minivan, it was an entirely different color than the minivan I had entered. Like, the minivan I had gotten into was red, but my dad's minivan was blue. Yeah, I don't know. To my enormous relief, it started up right away, and when I got back to my dad's house, the Ben & Jerry's was delicious.
